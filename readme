Required dependencies:
pip3 install Flask-SQLAlchemy
pip3 install Flask

Error encountered:
I meet a package installation error, I tried to use" pip3 install Flask-SQLAlchemy" to install SQLAlchemy package, but it still displayed no module named flask_sqlalchemy. I moved the whole project to Linux environment and the problem solved after pip3 command. I think that's because there is a conflict between flask_sqlalchemy package and another package under windows environment.
